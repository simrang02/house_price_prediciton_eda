    "The data set used here will be helpful for us to predict the house sales based on the different parameters like- when was it first bought, how many bathrooms does it have, how much is the area covered by the house, what is the condition of the house etc. This is a general data set, that is observed and collected on various different parameters. Mostly parameters are continuous in nature except the condition and grade of the house, which are ordinal.\n",

    "The various attributes on which the data is observed are:\n",
